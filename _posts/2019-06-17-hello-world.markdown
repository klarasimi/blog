'Hi' to anyone who could be bothered to read my thoughts and ranting. In case you would like to know, who I am, my name is Klara and I recently left my job as a Social Media Specialist to pursue a career in tech.

I've always been interested in computers and tech. Few months ago i burnt out and took it as a sign. If not now, then when? At the moment I'm trying to learn to code in Python as well as to grasp the basics of information security.

Wish me luck for I have not a slightest idea what am I doing.
