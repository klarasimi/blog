## What am I doing with my life?

I left marketing to find my place in tech. The idea is to summarize my journey from one to another for those, who could ever need them and for those, who would like to see, what is life like when you have no background, but you realize the career switch is the best way. 

Wish me luck, for I have not a slight idea what I am doing.

## Let's get technical

This website is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://github.com), I believe my repository [blog](https://github.com/klarasimi/blog) is somehow involved.

The site is built in Jekyll and uses the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.
